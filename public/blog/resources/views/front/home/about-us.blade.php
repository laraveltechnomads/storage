               About Roltonn
            </h2> --}}
            <p class="description">We have two manufacturing units situated in Sachin, Surat, both strategic locations equidistant from Ahmedabad and Mumbai. This gives us an advantage of low over heads of transportation / shipping costs – making our products easily available wherever the client might need them delivered at lower costs. Both plants are spread across 16000 sq ft each, with over 100 employees on payroll.
            </p>
            <p class="description">Our Infrastructure for manufacturing corrugated boxes consist of a dual line machine with automatic conversion. We have 2 online colour printers and slotters that can customise all sorts of printing needs. The final product is then sent to a drying chamber for the print to be set on the boxes.
            </p>
            <p class="description">The Manufacturing of paper courier bags takes place on a 5 drive rotogravure printing press that allows colour printing and application of online water repellent along with heat sealing on the edge, finishing the process with online drying. Its capacity is 100 meters/min. Our Machines are fully automatic with heat sealing and pouch making capabilities and a capacity of 100 bags per min.

         We have an in house Quality control laboratory that checks every batch for its Bursting strength, compression strength and other parameters.  This ensures that we deliver the packaging material as per the clients’ specific requirements. 
      </p>
      <p class="sub-description"> <br></p>
      <p class="sub-description"> 
         Bursting Strength Test checks the toughness of the walls of the corrugated board when subjected to force or pressure. We also ensure the Cobb sizing tester is used to determine the water resistance. The Cobb test is required for certain certifications, especially those involving hazardous material packaging. Once the product passes all the tests in the QC lab, the finished products are stored in warehouses for shipping to our clients.
